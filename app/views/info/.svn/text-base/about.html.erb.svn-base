			<h2 class="question">What is Tooshu?</h2>
			<p>
				Tooshu is the answer to the problems of book borrowing:	
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Library membership requirements</li>
				<li>Low library inventories</li>
				<li>Poor cataloging of available copies</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Instead of having one centralized location where books are stored, every member of Tooshu owns a small part of a distributed library.  Tooshu is the (free) tool to help everyone manage their collections.
			</p>
			<h2 class="question">Why is Tooshu better than a traditional library?</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Problem:</b> Traditional libraries have membership requirements.  You have to live in the community or be a student at a college to access library resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Answer:</b> Tooshu puts members in charge of the library.  Members own the books, so the can lend them out to whoever they want.  You don't have to live in a specific location or pay tuition.  Just find the person with the book and ask to borrow it.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<b>Problem:</b> Traditional libraries have lots of different books, but limited copies of each.  That means when the next best-seller comes out, not everyone can get a copy.
			</p>			
			<p>
				<b>Answer:</b> People tend to buy the most popular books, which means there are a lot of copies floating around (more than a single library holds).  Tooshu makes it easy find these copies by letting users post their collections for others to see.
			</p>
			<h2 class="question">Why should I sign up?</h2>
			<p>
				Once you sign up, you can immediately start searching the books that other users own and you start borrowing them.  Borrowing books can save you lots of money, and it's completely free to sign up!
			</p>
			<p>
				Just remember, people are more likely to let you borrow a book if they know you're sharing your books too.  Luckily, Tooshu makes it incredibly fast and easy to list the books that you own for other members to see.
