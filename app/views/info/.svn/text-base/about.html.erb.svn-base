			<h2 class="question">What is Tooshu?</h2>
			<p>
				Tooshu is a platform for borrowing and lending books.  Tooshu lets you find books you find books you want to read and helps you keep track of who borrowed books from you.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="question">How does Tooshu work?</h2>
			<p>
				Instead of having one centralized location where books are stored, every member of Tooshu owns a small part of a distributed library.  Tooshu is the (free) tool to help everyone manage their collections.
			</p>
			<h2 class="question">Why should I join Tooshu?</h2>
			<p>
				<em>To Save Money!</em>  Books are expensive (especially textbooks).  Why not save some money and borrow a book instead of buying it?  Tooshu will help you find people who own the books you want to borrow!
			</p>
			<h2 class="question">What does it cost to join Tooshu?</h2>
			<p>
				<em>NOTHING!</em>  All we ask is that you list some books you'd be willing to lend to other Tooshu users.
			</p>
			
			<h2 class="question">Why is Tooshu better than a traditional library?</h2>
			<p>
				<b>Problem:</b> Traditional libraries have membership requirements.  You have to live in the community or be a student at a college to access library resources.
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Answer:</b> Tooshu puts members in charge of the library.  Members own the books, so they can lend them out to whomever they want.  You don't have to live in a specific location or pay tuition.  Just find the person with the book and ask to borrow it.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<b>Problem:</b> Traditional libraries have lots of different books, but limited copies of each book.  That means when the next best-seller comes out, not everyone can get a copy.
			</p>			
			<p>
				<b>Answer:</b> People tend to buy the most popular books, which means there are a lot of copies floating around (more than a single library holds).  Tooshu makes it easy find these copies by letting users post their collections for others to see.
